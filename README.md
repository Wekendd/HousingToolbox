# Housing Toolbox

A mod to improve the Hypixel Housing developer experience.

## Current Features
* Input Improvements
    * **Anvil:** Just press `enter` to confirm input!
    * **Signs:** Just press `enter` to confirm input! (Don't worry, doesn't apply to all signs)
    * **Chat:** Automatically opens when input is requested, with your previous input waiting for you. No more pressing `T`!
* Keyboard Navigation in Systems
    * `CTRL+F`, `CTRL+C`, `CTRL+V`, and `CTRL+Z`! All rebindable!
    * Assign keys to turn pages, open system menus (Housing Menu, Functions, Events), and go back to your previous page without having to touch the mouse.
* **(SOON!)** Full keyboard navigation: traverse entire menus without touching your mouse.

Sensible defaults are set, so you won't be bombarded with random keybinds you didn't set.
